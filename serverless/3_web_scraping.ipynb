      "      This fall, field trips in Vienna to the Donau-Auen National Park and urban farms, as well as the launch of CEU’s new Sustainability Hub, encourage students and CEU community members to develop habits for environmental stewardship and participate in localized efforts for climate resiliency. CEU aims to serve as a model for environmentally responsible practices in higher education, from research that shapes global sustainability efforts to operations and governance that drive meaningful change.“While the climate crisis requires action from everyone, institutions of higher education have a special obligation to do their part,” said CEU Interim Rector and President Carsten Q. Schneider. “At CEU, we embrace our responsibility to shape future decision-makers and advance knowledge that supports a more sustainable world. Sustainability is not separate from our mission - it strengthens it.”  \n",

      "       Exploring Biodiversity and Water Management Along the Danube In September, students and faculty from CEU’s Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy started their academic year with a field trip to Donau-Auen National Park, a floodplain landscape with active river revitalization projects reconnecting natural side waters to the Danube river.  The visit exposed CEU students to sustainable water management and habitat restoration in Vienna. It also provided an informal opportunity to discuss environmental justice with faculty and peers, as well as which specific courses at CEU will support further learning on topics explored at the Donau-Auen National Park.  Combining Ecological Science With Farming Practices  In October, students from the department’s Agroecology and Organic Gardening Systems  course traveled to Vienna’s Grand Farm and the Laaerberg Community Garden, to meet with active gardeners and farmers and also participate in activities for volunteers and the public, including a garden tour and harvest festival. CEU has a multi-year collaboration with Laaerberg Community Garden, which is based in Favoriten near campus.  The course, in conjunction with the visits, informs students how they can participate in localized opportunities to contribute to climate resiliency. Taught by Associate Professor Guntra Anda Aistara with CEU Environmental and Sustainability Officer Logan Strenchock, it offers a theoretical and practical introduction to agroecology and organic farming.  Pathways Toward Sustainability The university’s new Sustainability Hub, an internal platform for students, faculty and staff, plays a role in connecting the CEU community with volunteering opportunities for environmental activism and outreach with local Vienna-based sites and organizations. The hub also offers extensive information and resources on using land-based public transport for work travel purposes.  Additionally, it provides campus sustainability best practices on topics such as reducing printing requirements and reducing energy consumption related to data processing and digital storage for research and documentation purposes. As part of the hub’s events and thematic program series DIY:CEU, CEU’s Student Engagement Office, in collaboration with Strenchock, will offer a series of on campus education workshops this month dedicated to reuse, repair and self-sufficiency to build skills for reducing material consumption reduction the university community. Finally, the hub features current research, teaching and learning on environmental mitigation topics, largely connected to CEU’s Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy. \n",

      "      Also related to this work, CEU’s Sustainability Advisory Committee in collaboration with student groups and facilities conducted a survey, resulting in the inclusion of more plant-based meal and snack options included in the campus café’s daily offerings at affordable prices.  Such wide-spanning efforts and resource dissemination through coursework, site visits, and both institutional and individual practices all support CEU’s commitment to environmental responsibility.  Read more news about sustainability, environment and energy studies at CEU. \n",
